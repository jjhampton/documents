# Mission Statement

The Operation Code mentorship program serves to guide our community of service members and their families in their journey of learning to build software and starting a successful career in the tech industry.

# Programs
We offer two main mentorship platforms - [Mentor Service Requests](#mentor-service-requests), and [Squads](#squads).

# Mentor Service Requests (1 on 1)
Members can visit [http://op.co.de/mentor-request](http://op.co.de/mentor-request) to request a mentorship session.  Sessions are ~30 minute discussions between a mentee &  mentor via Slack, Voice Chat, or Video Chat.  A session should focus on a mentor helping a mentee with a specific task. Services offered are:

- General guidance (any topic)
- Pair programming
- Code review
- Mock interviews
- Resume review

Mentors can fill out [http://op.co.de/mentor-enrollment](http://op.co.de/mentor-enrollment) to volunteer as a mentor.

Mentors will watch [http://op.co.de/mentor-requests](http://op.co.de/mentor-requests) for mentee requests.  Any mentor can self-assign to an outstanding mentorship request on a first-come, first serve basis.   Mentors should mark the Airtable spreadsheet with their name as the  Mentor Assigned, add notes, and mark the request as ‘Fulfilled’ after the session takes place (or after a reasonable number of communication attempts).

Operation Code’s Mentorship Coordination team will help pair mentees/mentors and notify other mentors via Slack to fulfill outstanding requests.

After a mentorship session is fulfilled, mentees and mentors are free to continue the learning process on their own.  Mentees are also free to request a new mentorship session from another mentor or on a new topic.

# Squads
Squads are mentor-led small groups that work together towards a common goal over a longer period of time. Examples are building a small project together, learning a specific language, or working through an online-learning platform such as Codecademy or FreeCodeCamp.

Squads will have:
- A finite, measurable goal the squad can work towards.
- At least one mentor serving as Squad Leader, and one additional mentor to assist
- A minimum/maximum number of mentees
- A weekly schedule of activities for the squad (office hours, study sessions, exercises, etc.)
- An end date or success condition for the squad

Mentors can visit [https://op.co.de/squad-request](https://op.co.de/squad-request) to set up a squad.
